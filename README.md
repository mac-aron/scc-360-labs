# SCC.369 lab work

This repository is cloned from [micro:bit v2 samples](https://github.com/lancaster-university/microbit-v2-samples/). All work is part of the SCC.369 Embedded Systems module at Lancaster University. 

## Labs

Work for each lab (a total of 3 labs + mini-project) is available in a separate branch. 

### Lab 1 - working with GPIO (completed)

The aim of this exercise is to familiarize you with a native C development environment, the
Arm microcontroller architecture, and some basic input and output (often abbreviated IO or
I/O). This exercise will give you an understanding of the fundamental characteristics of
embedded systems.

### Lab 2 - timers and interrupts (completed)

The aim of this exercise is to introduce you to the hardware Timer peripherals that are
typically found on microcontroller systems, and how the use of interrupts can allow you to
create power efficient, real-time systems.

### Lab 3 - communications (incomplete)

The aim of this exercise is to introduce you to using some of the communications peripherals
that are typically found on microcontroller systems. You will also discover how simple serial
port communication can be implemented purely in softwareâ€¦

## How to run?

First, please ensure you've completed all the installation steps in the original repository (link above). 

1. Compile the code `python3 build.py`
2. Copy the resulting HEX file onto the micro:bit
